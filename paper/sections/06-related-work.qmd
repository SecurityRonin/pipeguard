## Supply Chain Security

Ladisa et al. [@ladisa2023taxonomy] provide a comprehensive taxonomy of attacks on open source supply chains, identifying 107 unique attack vectors across 94 real-world incidents. Their work highlights the growing sophistication of supply chain attacks and the need for defense at multiple layers. PipeGuard addresses one specific vector in this taxonomy: malicious installation scripts.

Ohm et al. [@ohm2020backstabber] analyze malicious code injection in package managers, demonstrating how attackers exploit post-install scripts---a mechanism similar to `curl | bash` execution. Their findings inform our YARA rule development for detecting staged payloads.

The SLSA framework [@slsa] establishes supply chain security levels focusing on build provenance. PipeGuard complements SLSA by addressing installation-time threats that occur after build but before deployment.

Zimmermann et al. [@zimmermann2019npm] study security threats in the npm ecosystem, finding that a single malicious package can impact thousands of downstream projects. While focused on npm, their analysis of dependency-based attacks informs our understanding of how `curl | bash` serves as an entry point for supply chain compromise.

## Provenance-Based Detection

Han et al. [@han2020provenance] present PROVDETECTOR for hunting stealthy malware via data provenance analysis. Their approach tracks information flow through system calls, which could complement PipeGuard's pre-execution scanning with post-execution verification.

Hassan et al. [@hassan2025orthrus] achieve high-quality attribution in provenance-based intrusion detection. Their work on reducing false positives in provenance graphs informs our multi-stage detection approach.

## Malware Detection Approaches

YARA [@yara] has become the standard for malware pattern matching. Lockett [@lockett2021yara] assesses YARA's effectiveness for signature-based detection, finding high accuracy when rules are well-maintained. Li et al. [@li2022yara] demonstrate 97% accuracy with ML-generated YARA rules, suggesting future directions for automated rule generation in PipeGuard.

Pendlebury et al. [@pendlebury2019tesseract] address concept drift in ML-based malware detection, a challenge we avoid through deterministic YARA rules with manual updates. Their work suggests caution in over-relying on ML approaches for rapidly-evolving threats.

## Shell and Script Security

Snow et al. [@snow2011shellos] present SHELLOS for fast detection of code injection attacks, using hardware virtualization for efficient analysis. While focused on binary shellcode, their performance optimization techniques inform our sandbox design.

Jovanovic et al. [@jovanovic2006pixy] pioneer static analysis for web application vulnerability detection. PipeGuard adapts similar taint-tracking concepts for shell script analysis.

Kim et al. [@kim2015breaking] analyze sandbox escape techniques, informing our sandbox profile design to minimize attack surface while maintaining analysis fidelity.

## macOS Security Research

Blochberger et al. [@blochberger2019sandbox] investigate macOS application security through sandbox analysis, finding inconsistent policy enforcement. Their findings validate our decision to use custom sandbox profiles rather than relying on system defaults.

Blazakis [@blazakis2011sandbox] provides foundational research on macOS sandbox-exec, which PipeGuard uses for behavioral analysis.

## Clipboard Security

Wang et al. [@wang2018clipboard] study cross-application clipboard data leakage. While focused on privacy, their analysis of clipboard manipulation informs our understanding of pastejacking attacks that PipeGuard's ZLE interception layer addresses.
